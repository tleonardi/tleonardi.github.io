<h1>My first page</h1>

<p class="text-justify">Hi there, this is my first post.
It's my first attempt at making a Jekyll site based on bootstrap, and for the moment it looks pretty neat!
The plan is to use this website as something halfway between a static site and a blog where I can post guides/articles/projects and whatever needs a home on the web.
</p>

<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
<h4 class="text-center">Posts</h4>
<div class="list-group text-center">
  {% for post in site.posts limit: 5 %}
  	<a href="{{ post.url }}" class="list-group-item">
		<h5 class="list-group-item-heading">{{ post.title }}</h5>
		<p class="list-group-item-text">{{ post.description }}</p>
	</a>
  {% endfor %}

</div>

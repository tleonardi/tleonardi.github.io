<h1>Foobar</h1>
<div class="text-justify">
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>this is the home for my guides, articles, little projects and various thoughts.</p>
<p>It was born as an attempt at making a Jekyll site based on bootstrap, but then I realised that I was quite happy with the result I started using it to post some content.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the site rather than its content, check it out on github!</p>

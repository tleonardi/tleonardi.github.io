# Spaghetti on TV

Some people might know that last year I took part in the Mongolia Charity Rally. To make a long story short, together with 8 friends I drove the ~13.000Km between Italy and Mongolia.

A few weeks ago the story was picked up by Tele2000, an Italian national TV. They invited the team in the studios (I did not go though, as they wouldn't pay for my ticket from Cambridge) and ran a nice service on us. 

Here it is (it's in italian, but if you want to laugh you can activate the subtitles and then have them automatically translated):
